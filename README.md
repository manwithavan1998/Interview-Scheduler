# Interview-Scheduler
This is a project where the admin can schedule an interview with an interviewer and an interviewee.
If at the time of scheduling an interview, any of the participants are not available , then the page will re-direct to an error page.
You can see the total interview list by clicking on the interview list tab on the navigation bar.



Things that can be implemented differently :
* Multiple interviewees can be an option for an interview.
* In place of interviewer id, name and description could be used.
* Interview List could be represented using table.
